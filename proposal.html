<h1 class="proposal-h1">The New Addiction?</h1>

<h2 class="proposal-h2">Mobile phones: are we becoming more dependent on them and influenced by what we see on social media?</h2>


<h4>Introduction</h4>

    <p>Many advances in technology have taken place over the last number of years, including an increase in broadband and internet speed, and the improvement of technology and the services they offer.  These advances are resulting in more people using mobile phones for work, social activity and entertainment, resulting in an increased amount of time spent online. </p>

    <p>People use technology within both their working and non-working lives, while some features on these devices are useful in our busy lives, the lines regarding usage is becoming blurred.  Forums such as social media are great for allowing people to stay in touch, however, I believe there are many negative factors associated with our dependency on our mobile phones.</p>

    <p>I often wonder why people are so obsessed with their phones; this addiction appears quite intense, and it appears to be growing in intensity with each generation.  It has become more apparent among my peer group that people are developing a level of anxiety if separated from their phones for any length of time, which is quite worrying.  This level of obsession is reinforced by author, Catherine Price who stated: “my mobile phone is the last thing I touch before I go to bed, and the first thing I reach for in the morning.”</p>


<h4>The Addiction</h4>

    <p>Addiction can be defined as continuing to seek out something, despite negative consequences; Catherine Price carried out a survey which revealed that 62% of consumers agreed with the statement: ‘I can’t image my life without my mobile phone.’  Are we ready to admit we are addicted to our mobile phones?  </p>

    <p>Research carried out by Catherine Price also highlighted that the average person in the UK spends more than 2 hours a day on their mobile phone, this equates to 14 hours a week, 60 hours a month or 30 days a year. Some adults spend up to 8.4 hours a day on screens, with 1.7 hours on social media.</p>

    <p>According to the Royal Society for Public Health, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are used by 1 in 4 people worldwide, with Facebook having 32 million users in the UK.  Social media addiction affects around 5% of young people, with 91% of 16-24 year old’s using the internet for social networking.  Young people aged between 16-19 years check their phones on average 90 times per day, with over a quarter of teenagers admitting to responding to messages during the night.  These alarming statistics have caused me to reflect on the amount of time I spend on my mobile phone and I have to ask myself, “am I addicted?”</p>

    <p>Having considered the statistics, it appears that our addiction to our phones and social media is widespread across every age group, but more severe in the 16-24-year old group.  I wonder if perhaps social media is more addictive than alcohol and cigarettes?</p>


<h4>Why the Addiction?</h4>

    <p>Why do people spend so much time on their mobile phones?  </p>

    <p>Sometimes we reach for our phones for practical reasons, sometimes it’s our subconscious, sometimes it’s a need to feel connected or leveraging our need for affirmation.  Is our attachment a societal addiction and is it caused by something else?</p>

    <p>Dopamine is a ‘neurotransmitter’, it is a compound in the body that is used by the brain to send signals to the muscles in the body to make them move; it can also be used to make a person feel good as it plays a major role in the motivational component of reward-motivated behaviour.  Why is this relevant?  It appears that when people get a ‘like’ on Facebook or Instagram, dopamine is released, activating pleasure-related receptors in our brains, teaching us to associate certain behaviours with rewards.  It encourages us to not just care about other people’s judgements, but to ask for them.  </p>

    <p>According to writer and comedian Aziz Ansari: “Whenever you check for a new post on social media, it’s not even about the content. It’s just about seeing a new thing. You get addicted to that feeling.”  We constantly check our phones to see if other people agree that we are popular; as humans we have an instinctive desire for belonging and affirmation, but the more ways there are for us to be judged, the more we monitor our scores.  We love getting reactions or reinforcements to the things we do. I believe this is a major issue for the younger generation who are constantly comparing how many likes they receive, followers they have, or ‘streaks’ they receive. </p>

    <p>This is reinforced by American Psychologist, Larry Rosen who believes that people have a desire for new information, he said: “Our phones deliberately incite anxiety by providing new information and emotional triggers every time we pick them up.”</p>

    <p>Naomh McElhatton delivered a TED Talk about being ‘socially disconnected’, she described social media as the ‘crack cocaine of the digital age’ where we are living ‘superficial lifestyles in a selfie culture’.  Do we compare our lives to those we follow, constantly feeling the need for approval?</p>


<h4>The Implications</h4>

    <p>While we may be aware of our growing addiction to both our mobile phones and social media accounts, we may not be aware of the effect it is having on our lives.  The perception we see daily on social media of how to look, how to live, and how to have fun is having an impact on many people, causing a range of emotions (positive and negative), some of which can lead to mental health or physical problems.  </p>

    <p>According to Psychologist Jean Twenge: “The arrival of the smartphone has radically changed every aspect of teenagers’ lives, from the nature of their social interactions, to their mental health.”  As a young female, I believe that people’s perceptions around their body image is hugely influenced by TV, media and social media.  Many females compare themselves to models and how they look.  Even with an awareness of airbrushing and filtering which is used to enhance images, many females are still influenced by what they see.  </p>

    <p>Research carried out by the Royal Society for Public Health revealed that as many as 9 out of every 10 teenage females in their 20-30’s say they are unhappy with their body.  According to Sanctus, 62% of people feel ‘inadequate’, comparing themselves with others’ online.  Co-founder, George Bettany stated: “The unrealistic expectations set by social media may leave young people with feelings of self-consciousness, low self-esteem and the pursuit of perfectionism which can manifest as anxiety disorders.”   </p>


<h4>Conclusion</h4>

    <p>It appears that most people, regardless of their age, have an intimate relationship with their mobile phone, and for a lot of people, social media has a huge influence on their lives.  </p>

    <p>It’s the effect this is having on people which is worrying, the reality is that many people have a ‘fake online persona’, they create an illusion of the person they want others to see, including stories and modified images that make their lives look exciting.  This is causing others to examine their lives which may appear mundane, boring and ordinary.  These feelings can lead to people feeling a range of emotions, including jealousy, inadequacy, loneliness or being a ‘failure’.  This is affecting people’s confidence levels and how they view themselves.  </p>

    <p>As a society we need to consider the amount of time we spend on our mobile phones, could we use our time more constructively?  It is also important to reflect on the extent by which we are influenced by what we see on social media.</p>
